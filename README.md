# Software-Development

The project entitled SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM has been designed and developed in such a way that any school may use it. 
The aim of the software is to automate various functions that are being performed in most of the schools in general like assignment submission, internal marks updating etc. 
This software brings all school management processes, from assignment submission to generation of scorecards of the students and their record graphs.
